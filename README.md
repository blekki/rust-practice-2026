## Description

A hub for saving various projects for my rust practice.

## Build and launch

Before using repo you need install dependencies.
* `rust`
* `cargo`

Fast way to install them on Linux (Ubuntu, Mint):
```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rustc cargo
```

Use the following commands to build the projects and check unit tests as a way understand does project work correctly.
```shell
cargo build
cargo test
```

## Run
Only one command... no more.
```shell
cargo run
```

## PS:

You can find the origin repo author of the template I used by the next [URL](https://github.com/djnzx/rust-practice).
